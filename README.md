# audiocue-tutorial-examples

[*AudioCue*](https://github.com/philfrei/AudioCue-maven) is a Java class for audio playback from memory, modeled on the 
`javax.sound.sampled.Clip` class, but with concurrent playback and built-in real time controls for volume, pan and speed.
This library (*audiocue-tutorial-examples*) is a set of programs which demonstrate many of *AudioCue's* capabilities.
